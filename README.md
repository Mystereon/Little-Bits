Cellular Life Automata in colour with Nuke for M5stickC  - create life , it asks to be fed.

A little rewrite of the Cellular Automata demo supplied with the MstickC display library in colour
with an optional 'nuke' from the m5 button , and a battery and temp monitor on the side button .
As the battery falls below 3.8v it will ask to be fed -- i.e plugged into USB
I do like the way it erodes the background as life spreads.
I will be adding more as the pocket lava lamp concept is rather fun :). 
I shall mindmap the functions and see how the IMU could play out in this , plus maybe an IR trigger
that could interact with other sticks like a furby would.

Enjoy :)
